# CosmWasm NFTS

This repo is the official repository to work on all NFT standard and examples
in the CosmWasm ecosystem. `cw721` and `cw721-base` were moved from
[`cw-plus`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) to start this repo, but it shall evolve
as driven by the community's needs.

Please feel free to modify cw721 as you need to support these projects and add many extensions
and additional standards (like [cw-2981](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/pull/414)) to meet
the demands of the various NFT projects springing forth.

## Maintainers

but rather by 4 highly active community members working on NFT projects of their own:

If you are working on an NFT project as well and wish to give input, please raise issues and/or PRs.
Additional maintainers can be added if they show commitment to the project.
